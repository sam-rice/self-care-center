# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application generates either an "affirmation" or "mantra" and displays it to the user, depending on their choice, within the wrappings of "meditative" styling and animation.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your new, forked repo to your local machine.
3. cd into the project's parent-level repository on your local machine.
4. Open all files in your text editor.
5. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project was assigned to me during the third week (first module) of Turing's front-end software engineering program. I spent approximately 20 hours creating it.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals of this project were to build something from the ground up, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Prior to this project, we hadn't had the oppurtunity to write JavaScript for HTML/CSS that was also written by us, so getting to plan something from the ground up was a new experience. 

Additionally, we continued to work with the DOM and integrating it with our data model.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

One major win for me was getting all the way through the "Intermediate CSS" extension, which by far took the most time. Approximately five hours alone were spent on learning how to use animations and struggling to get a particular idea for an animation I had to work. Eventually, I came across the right combinations of YouTube videos and MDN documentation and got it.

My other big win is also CSS-related. I hadn't used Flexbox before, and for that reason, I decided to complete the MVP without it. Because of this, I had to undo a lot of the initial styling once I decided to switch to Flexbox. I could've probably styled it more quickly if I'd started with Flexbox to begin with (and definitely will next time), but having to re-engineer the same elements with a different technology was a good learning experience. Coming out of the project, I feel like I have a pretty solid understanding of Flexbox basics, and can take that with me into the my project.
